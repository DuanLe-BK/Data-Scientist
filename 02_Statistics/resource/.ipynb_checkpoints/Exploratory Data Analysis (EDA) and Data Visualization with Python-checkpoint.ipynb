    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach to analyzing data sets by summarizing their main characteristics with visualizations. The EDA process is a crucial step prior to building a model in order to unravel various insights that later become important in developing a robust algorithmic model.\n",

    "Different operations where EDA comes into play:\n",
    "* First and foremost, EDA provides a stage for breaking down problem statements into smaller experiments which can help understand the dataset\n",
    "* EDA provides relevant insights which help analysts make key business decisions\n",
    "* The EDA step provides a platform to run all thought experiments and ultimately guides us towards making a critical decision"
